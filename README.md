# Skilline

_Skilline_ is my first HTML-project and GitHub repository that I completed during the 5th week of my frontend learning at [ITGirlSchool].

The assignment was to create a basic landing page using flexbox. Additionally, we were required to incorporate a minimum of 3 selectors, 3 pseudo-elements, and a non-standard font.

At the time, I was extremely proud of the outcome. Although I now recognize the project's imperfections, I want to preserve it as is, without any modifications or enhancements, as a reminder of the progress I've made and as a marker of the path I've traversed.
