# Skilline

Skilline is my very first html-project and github-repository completed on the 5th week of study at [ITGirlSchool].

The task was to build a simple landing page using flexbox. In addition, at least 3 selectors, 3 pseudo-elements and a non-standart font were to be used.

At that time I was very proud of the result and, though I find it very unperfect now, I want to keep it here without amendment as a souvenir.
